NetduinoHomeSecurity
====================

A home security example using Netduino and Windows Azure. This project was created as a hands on hacknight
for the Charlotte Alt.Net users group.  During this meeting attendees will write code for a Netduino
that will complete a Simulated Home Security system.

This repo contains the Netduino part of the solution.  Check out https://github.com/mlinnen/CloudHomeSecurity 
for the repo that contains the Windows Azure part of the solution.
